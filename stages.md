Provides web accessibility studies.

### Testing

- scale browser width to 1280 px and zoom 400%. Data should be enlarged without losing it's functionality.

### Improvements

Images

- correct usage of the alt attribute. Specify an alt message when important.  
E.g. decorative images have no importance, it's alt message could be left empty. 

Cards

- only navigation software is by law required to comply to specific WCAG rules.

Alerts

- don't use alerts for static content. E.g. an informative message which is always shown.
Alerts should be used to alert a reaction.

Errors

- no generic error messages. Use clear and informative messages. Define boundaries, use values (min, max), ....

Icons

- don't use icons without a corresponding label
- use meaningful /logical icons (avoid confusion, contradictions)

Titels

- use meaningful titels, specific per page

Focus

- focus on the active element. E.g opening an panel with new buttons, should focus on the newly visible buttons.
